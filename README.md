Birthday Challenge
Introduction

mathbirthdays.com is a site that wants to help people celebrate their special "math birthdays." A "math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc. 

The mathbirthdays.com site is very simple. There is a way to select your birth date, and the page shows your next upcoming math birthday. For example, if your birth date was 3 days ago, it would say "Your next math birthday is your 10-day-old birthday on X date," where X date is a week from now. The site is a single html file with no assets. All css and javascript is inline or hosted in publicly accessible locations elsewhere (like jquery or other frameworks).
